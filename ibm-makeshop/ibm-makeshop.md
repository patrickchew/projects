#IBM Make Shop

#### Statement of Purpose
The IBM Make Shop is a space dedicated to creating a sustainable culture of making at IBM. We are intent on working with not just the digital, but also with the physical. As designers, we want and need to use our hands to do more than push pixels. Here, we use them to pull squegees and to guide paintbrushes, to do anything and everything to make.
